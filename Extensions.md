### Particularities of Gambit-C Scheme

Some extensions to the Scheme programming language are introduced below.
This (non exhaustive) list is intended for the users who want to know
more about the features of Gambit without parsing the whole
documentation.

  - To allow user-defined types and structures, with many enhancements
    to enable inheritance, read-only fields and others options, see the
    [define-type](define-type "wikilink") page.

<!-- end list -->

  - Modular [hash-tables](hash-tables "wikilink") are provided, where
    you can select your hash functions, your equality predicates, use
    weak pointers, etc.

<!-- end list -->

  - What about some [extra parameters](extra_parameters "wikilink") such
    as keys, optional parameters, references to whole parts of code,
    etc?
