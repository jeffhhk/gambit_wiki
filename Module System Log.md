## Day1 (March 12)

Christian Jaeger (pflanze) and James Long (jlongster) have met on the
\#scheme IRC channel on freenode.net, and got some advice (and a
provisional gambit wrapper for Riaxpander), and have discussed why
hygienic macro systems rename symbols and that when using namespaces in
the symbols, this might be enough as "rename" means, thus providing nice
integration with preexisting namespace-using Gambit code.

After that they continued discussion privately and exchanged thoughts on
precompiling code and what this has to do with first-class modules
("first-class modules" being a wrapper around namespaces+contents,
basically), and more. Decision to start writing wiki pages, accept one
student, and announce this to the Gambit mailing list.

## Days 2-7 (March 13-18)

CJ mainly studied GSoC documentation and google group discussions, added
license declaration to the project page, discovered \#gambit IRC channel
(together with JL), carrying out various discussions (with JL, Marc,
Guillaume Cartier), checked pkg-config hint by G.Cartier, started
reading paper by M.Flatt, created
[Module\_System/Virtual\_Library](Module%20System/Virtual%20Library.md)
page, (talk with D. Peschel about [Namespaces](Namespaces.md)
wiki page), observed \#gsoc channel during the time when GSoC program
manager LH explained how selection has happened. Two Mails to the
Gambit-ml. "Nothing much", but all in all some learning experiences.
