## Scheme in a nutshell

  - Scheme is a dialect of the
    [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\(programming_language\))
    programming language developed in the 70s, that inherently supports
    *[functional
    programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)*
    but is easily
    *[multi-paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm)*.

  - Scheme is one of the two major Lisp dialects used for
    general-purpose programming, the other one being [Common
    Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp).

  - Scheme provides very few primitives defined in its core (known as
    the "RnRS standard" where "n" is an integer) as the rest is defined
    in extensions or libraries.

  - Scheme can be used for any kind of software development and can be
    learned in a single day thanks to its minimalist yet powerful
    design.

  - *[High
    order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_programming)*
    programming and
    *[macros](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/info-dylan-archive-html-2002/msg00070.html)*
    allow the developers using Scheme to write efficient and easily
    maintainable code, hence Scheme's label as the programming language
    of choice for many industries as well as academics.

  - Among programming languages, Scheme is quite unique about natively
    supporting
    [continuations](http://community.schemewiki.org/?call-with-current-continuation),
    a very powerful language construct using which for instance
    exception handling,
    [coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), and
    [weblocks](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-weblocks/) behaviour
    can be implemented.

Scheme is a solid way to state of the art software development.

## Literature

  - [Structure and Interpretation of Computer
    Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) is a Computer Science book
    that uses Scheme. You find the book on its web site, and its videos
    on
    [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=SICP+&search_type=&aq=f)
    and on a
    [homepage](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/).

  - [An Introduction to Scheme and its
    Implementation](http://www.federated.com/~jim/schintro-v14/schintro_toc.html)
    ([alternative
    link](ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/cs345/schintro-v14/schintro_toc.html))
    is a practical hands-on guide to Scheme, for people new to software
    development, as well as for people with a background in general
    programming languges such as C, C++, Java, Pascal, PHP, etc.
