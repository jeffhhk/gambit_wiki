## What's Gambit?

Gambit consists of two main programs: **gsi**, the Gambit Scheme
interpreter, and **gsc**, the Gambit Scheme compiler. The interpreter
contains the complete execution and debugging environment. The compiler
is the interpreter extended with the capability of generating executable
files. The compiler can produce standalone executables or compiled
modules which can be loaded at run time. Interpreted code and compiled
code can be freely mixed.

Gambit-C is a version of the Gambit programming system in which the
compiler generates portable C code. The main features of Gambit-C are:

  - **Conformance.** The Gambit-C system conforms to the R4RS, R5RS and
    IEEE Scheme standards and implements all optional features. Tail
    calls and first class continuations conform to the Scheme semantics.
    The full numeric tower is implemented, including: arbitrary
    precision integers (bignums), rationals, inexact reals (floating
    point numbers), and complex numbers. Several extensions to Scheme
    are provided, including: lightweight threads, a foreign-function
    interface (FFI), and extended I/O capabilities (Unicode, networking,
    subprocesses, ...).
  - **Portability.** Because the system is mostly written in Scheme and
    the compiler generates portable C code, it is easy to port the
    system as well as programs compiled with it to any platform with a
    decent C or C++ compiler. There is no reliance on a particular C
    compiler, although the system can take advantage of some
    **gcc**-specific constructs. The C code generated is oblivious to
    the endianness and word size of the target environment (32 and 64
    bit architectures are currently supported). There are no external
    library dependencies, and OS API dependencies can be removed so as
    to run directly on the bare metal. The system includes
    high-performance bignum support utilizing sophisticated algorithms,
    implemented in Scheme.
  - **Performance.** The compiler includes several powerful program
    transformations such as user procedure inlining, partial-evaluation,
    and lambda-lifting. With appropriate declarations in the source code
    the executable programs generated by the compiler run roughly as
    fast as equivalent C programs. Programs containing no declarations
    are also optimized without compromising the Scheme semantics by
    speculatively inlining predefined procedures (see the
    [benchmarks](benchmarks "wikilink") page for a comparison with other
    Scheme implementations and other languages). Thanks to an efficient
    implementation of continuations, the thread system is very efficient
    and can support millions of concurrent threads.
  - **Reliability.** Stable releases typically have very few bugs. Bug
    tracking is done with the [issue tracker on
    github](https://github.com/gambit/gambit/issues). Gambit-C has been
    used to develop large-scale [ real-world software and
    services](Real-world_software_and_services "wikilink") in academic
    and commercial settings.

An overview of the Gambit system was presented by Marc Feeley at the
[2010 International Lisp
Conference](http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2010/index).

## Getting Gambit

Gambit is available as prebuilt and source code
[distributions](distributions "wikilink"). There are prebuilt
distributions for Mac OS X, iPhone/iPod touch/iPad (on Apple App Store),
Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems. The source code
distributions must be compiled with a C or C++ compiler. The latest
sources are available at the [Gambit repo on
github](https://github.com/gambit/gambit).

## Documentation

[Documentation](Documentation "wikilink") is available.

### Reporting bugs

Please use the [issue tracker on
github](https://github.com/gambit/gambit/issues). Note that the bugzilla
bug tracker previously used ([Gambit bugzilla bug
tracker](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/bugzilla/)) will be phased
out in favour of the github issue tracker.
