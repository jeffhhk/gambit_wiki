Sakuryaku is the tentative name for a set of emacs extensions to
gambit.el. One day it will be more slime then slime, but for now, it is
just an idea, with a little bit of elisp.

It is split apart into a few sections:

  - sakuryaku-repl.el - REPL helper functions (coming soon, an ECB
    status bar)
  - sakuryaku-docco.el - Grab documentation from info files (coming
    soon, a hook into eldoc)
  - sakuryaku-gambit-ext.el - extensions to gambit.el

I'll post it to the wiki, until I find a better home for it (git repos
somewhere, possibly github)
